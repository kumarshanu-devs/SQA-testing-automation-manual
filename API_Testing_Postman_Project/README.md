2. **POST**: Create a new post.
3. **PUT**: Update an existing post.
4. **DELETE**: Delete a post.

## Project Structure
- `requests_collection.json`: Postman collection containing all CRUD requests.
- `API_Testing_Report.md`: Summary of test results and findings.
- `Screenshots/`: Folder containing screenshots of test execution.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Use
1. Import the `requests_collection.json` into Postman.
2. Run each request and validate the responses.
3. Review the report for analysis and findings.
